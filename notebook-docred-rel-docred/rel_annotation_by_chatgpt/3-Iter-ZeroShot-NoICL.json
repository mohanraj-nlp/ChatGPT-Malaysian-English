[{"idx": 0, "text": "Vithura is a small village situated 36 \u00a0 km from Thiruvananthapuram , capital of the Kerala state in India . Vithura is the crossroads to various tourist , cultural , and religious centres . Surrounded by the Western Ghats ( Sahyadri ) , Vithura is a prime tourist spot . The Village is rich with scenic beauty and good climate . The campus for the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research , Thiruvananthapuram is being constructed here . There are several rubber plantations . Prominent tourist spots include Ponmudi , Peppara Dam , Meenmutty Falls , Bonacaud and Agastyakoodam . The 2001 census reports a population of 26,927 . A stones throw away from Vithura lies Iruthalamoola Junction in the Tholicode Panchayath . Iru in Malayalam means two and Thala means head and moola means corner . Perhaps the place got its name because the Trivandrum to Ponmudi and Vithura to Aryanad roads meet at Eruthalamoola Junction . Perched on a hill very close to Iruthalamoola stands a massive magnificent rock called Chittiparra . Chittiparra is frequented by adventure type tourists keen on the challenges of rock climbing . Lush green paddy fields , rubber plantations , coconut gardens abound in scenic Vithura which is a hot spot for the thousands of tea plantation workers who work in the hills . A visit to the rubber plantations , including the local kalaris ( Traditional Martial Arts Schools ) is a must to every visitor .", "chatgpt": [{"entity_pair": {"head": "Thiruvananthapuram", "tail": "Kerala state"}, "relation": "capital of"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Kerala state"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Western Ghats"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Sahyadri"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Ponmudi"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Iruthalamoola Junction", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Iruthalamoola Junction", "tail": "Tholicode Panchayath"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Iru", "tail": "Malayalam"}, "relation": "NO_RELATION"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Chittiparra", "tail": "Iruthalamoola"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "tea plantation workers"}, "relation": "occupation"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Traditional Martial Arts Schools"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "rubber plantations"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "coconut gardens"}, "relation": "location"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "rubber plantations"}, "relation": "location"}], "gold": [{"entity_pair": {"head": "26,927", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "contains administrative territorial entity"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Bonacaud"}, "relation": "official language"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "36   km", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Thiruvananthapuram", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Thiruvananthapuram", "tail": "36   km"}, "relation": "located on terrain feature"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Thiruvananthapuram", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "located on terrain feature"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Peppara Dam", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Iruthalamoola Junction", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "located in the administrative territorial entity"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "located in the administrative territorial entity"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "located in the administrative territorial entity"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Thiruvananthapuram", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Vithura", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Kerala state", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "India", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Western Ghats", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Sahyadri", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Ponmudi", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Tholicode Panchayath", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Iru", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "Malayalam", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}, {"entity_pair": {"head": "two", "tail": "Vithura"}, "relation": "country"}]}]
